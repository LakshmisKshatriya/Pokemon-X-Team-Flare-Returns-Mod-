# Pokemon-X-Team-Flare-Returns-Mod-
My Work in Progress Pokemon X Mod, which increases the difficulty and makes Team Flare a lot more Stronger!

Mod Information
-
Mod Name : Pokemon X: The Return of Team Flare

Mod Release Date: Probably this month or next month

What does this Mod change?
- This mod changes the entire Team Flare these changes include:
level, pokemons, 6 pokemon for each of the Scientists (Aliana, Bryony, Celosia, Mable, Xeros) and Lysandre.
- pokemon stat changes (Includes Level up skills and their abilities)
- Wild Pokemon encounter changes
- Elite Four & Gym leader changes 
- Enemy Mega evolutions occur more often
- All pokemons from Pokemon Y are also avaible in this version
- Trainer changes
- Some Pokemons now have gems as items (Dark Gem, Ghost Gem etc.) according to their type. This basically means that you can farm those gems. If you dont know what they do: If you have a Pokemon with a Normal gem then his next Normal attack does more damage but the item goes away.
- and more!

Why did I create this Mod?

I didnt like that people kept saying that Team Flare is a bad team so I wanted to make them stronger!
