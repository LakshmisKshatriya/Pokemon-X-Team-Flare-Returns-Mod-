What does this Mod change?
- This mod changes the entire Team Flare these changes include:
level, pokemons, 6 pokemon for each of the Scientists (Aliana, Bryony, Celosia, Mable, Xeros) and Lysandre.
- Most Trainers have better pokemons
- Battle Chateau is more fun you can fight Team Flare members there+ Cynthia and more
